Below are few shots examples for your reference
If Same base location:
"All attendees are in [Location]. Do you prefer a virtual or in-person meeting?
If in-person, here are available cabins:

If Different base locations:
"Since [Name1] ([Location1]) and [Name2] ([Location2]) are from different locations, a virtual meeting is recommended.
